This is a website for team work, which created by Geeks. They are Dingdang and CAOKEE. We are planning to create a discussion board to record things.
Update:
1. We got a team now. They are Dingdang, XXSL, Caokee.

2. Now we pick up an aim. We want to make a portal site for our group. Let me think how to say that..."Fragment killing tea egg of Dingdang".</p>
